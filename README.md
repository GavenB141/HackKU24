## Inspiration
We were inspired by the fickle nature of speculative assets, and decided to put our skills together to create a web-based game about it.
## What it does
Our game simulates a real market by reacting to buy and sell orders placed by players in real time. While players gain a small amount of idle income, the goal of our game is to create a system where making trades is the best way to increase a players in game net worth. 
## How we built it
Our project is completely written in TypeScript and hosted on a Azure server. We store all user data  using Atlas cloud hosted MongoDB, and authenticate user sessions using PropelAuth. 
## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge we experienced was two of our members not knowing TypeScript/Svelte, as our entire project is written in it. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are happy to have made a complete _(enough)_ submission for the hackathon. This is three of our members first hackathon, so its a new experience to have to spend this much time crunching on a project. All in all I think everyone on our team is satisfied with the results of our work and enjoyed spending the weekend competing.
## What's next for Bit Pinch
Our Azure subscription running out at the end of the month. We would like to announce our projects EOL.
Thank you for your support.
